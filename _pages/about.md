## Me In 30 Seconds:	

I live by several mantras; I ain't afeared of no man nor ghost. I don't take no for an answer, no prisoners, and no crap from no one. When I foresee or detect any trouble, I proceed to kick butt, and stack'em 10 high.

I‚Äôm one of those rare people with a weird balance of being both left and right-brained. I play well with others, remain calm in emergencies, and am a top performer whether alone or working with a team. 

I've never been one to just sit on their laurels (whatever those are) waiting for things to happen. I enjoy working with people, learning new things, and engineering cool solutions. Check out [this page for recruiting information.](/recruiters) 

I love working with people and technology, and specialize in technical leadership. A lot of what I do each day, is help design great technology solutions, and influence others in making amazing decisions.

Thank you!
