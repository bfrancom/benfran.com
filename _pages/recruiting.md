## What's All the Hubbub, Bub?

If you've reached this page, you are likely coming from my [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benfrancom/) profile, or about page and want to see what all the hubbub is about.  I always keep one eyeball open for new opportunities, be they full-time, or consulting–but please note–I am very satisfied with my current position.

## What Does That Mean?

This means if you or the company you are working for is looking to take things to the next level with top talent, I am the person you are looking for. There are a few caveats:

* Checkout my [about](/about/) page to get to know me better.
* The position will need to be fan-freakin'-tastic! It definitely shouldn't be just a run-of-the-mill, boring company–unless of course you are Elon Musk, and it is [**the** boring company](https://www.boringcompany.com).
* Any opportunities would have to be super-compelling to even consider a change.
* The ability to Remote/Telecommute full-time from anywhere in the world. I'm not completely against going to an office, but there would need to be a very compelling reason as to why.
* Since I have a proven track record of saving or generating millions of dollars per year, pay will need to be within the top 10% of the industry. For more info and examples, please see:
  * [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/tools/salary-calculator/chief-systems-architect/salt-lake-city-ut?yrs=20&rptto=RL02&edu=EDLEV5&pfm=PR01&type=bonus)
  * [Glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/chief-architect-salary-SRCH_IM755_KO0,15.htm)
  * [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/t/solution-architect?countryId=254)

If this sounds like something you could offer, let's talk!

## Let's Make Your Dreams Come True!

If you want someone who is:

* A great and thoughtful leader
* Constantly thinking of ways to improve themselves, their work, and help others do the same
* Increasing business value (and $Millions per year) through automation, availability, reducing risk, optimizing business processes, and increasing customer satisfaction through technology....

Then look no further! I can be contacted via [e-mail](mailto:recruit@benfran.com) or [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benfrancom/).

Thanks!
