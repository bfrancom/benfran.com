I once had a friend from the UK.

He was telling me about an “awtistic” person.

That is how he pronounced it, not me.

So I says, “Did you say ‘artistic’ or ‘autistic’?

He says back to me, “yeah, ‘awtistic’, you know..someone who is highly focused, very creative, and has difficulty with social norms.

I no longer have a friend from the UK.
