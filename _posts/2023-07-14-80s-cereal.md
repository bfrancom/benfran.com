Back when I was a kid in the 80's, we couldn't afford all the cool gadgets, gizmos and toys all the other kids had.  This made it very challenging for me, who wanted everything my friends had. Especially the toys, food and goodies peddled (shoved) down my throat via broadcasted Saturday morning cartoons.

Remember back in the 80's all the colorful and extremely-awesome pure, unadulterated all-sugar-cereals that were advertised (as part of this complete breakfast)?  There was the normal cereals like Fruity Pebbles, Coco Puffs and Captain Crunch. Each cereal had their own whimsical commercials trying to outdo each other that were embedded with Saturday morning cartoons.

### Fruity Pebbles

With Fruity Pebbles based on the Flinstones cartoon. The commercials were pretty hilarious with Fred's anger issues exacerbated by Barney's shenanigans.

### Coco Puffs

There were people going cuckoo for Coco Puffs with that wacky bird-moose thing named Sonny. If Sonny was real, it would scare the ever-living deuce out of you. Sorry Tseven King, you got nuttin' on Sonny the bird-moose. I have no idea what this nightmare is doing in this image. Perhaps it's caught all of "us" which surely shivers my timbers.

### Cap'n Crunch

There was also Cap'n Crunch the old-timey French-looking Navy captain that spoke English like an American. I don't think he ever ate Cap'n Crunch because his mouth was never bleeding in the commercials.

## THE SPECIALTY ERA BEGINS!!!

Then there was an era of specialty cereals we've never seen the likes of before nor since. These were crossover cereals that were based on popular shows, cartoons, or video games. This is what sent my little brain into hyperdrive.

### Nintendo Cereal

There was Nintendo Cereal System that was popularized during the OG NES console video gaming days. Why was it good? We thought the commercial said, "Nintendo, it's a very good cereal!" Then we'd just sing that on loop. Why was it good? Because it was good! My brain didn't understand basic logic at the time. It was just good!


### Mr T. Cereal

I still pity any fools who never laid waste to these crispy yellow goodies. Wait a second! We were poor! I never got to taste Mr T cereal! I'm a fool! I pity myself.

Before moving on, I present you with another image of Mr T's irresistible cereal commercial mugshot. Who wouldn't want to be sliding this cereal down their gullet as fast as possible with this stamp of approval? I'm calling my mom to go get me some, right neeeeeoooooowwwww! Also, how could one person have so much pity for everyone? He's a class act for sure! That's why his cereal was the best around and nothing will ever come close to it again. Oh, and please Quaker, do not try to reboot this cereal. It won't work!



### Pacman cereal

We never got any of this either. After the PacMan fame had ran it's course and nobody wanted it, somehow my parents found bought some bulk toilet paper that had PacMan scratch-n-win something or others game in them. This was still like a dream come true for me. I remember sneaking into our storage room and opening packs of toilet paper just to sneak the PacMan cards out to see what I would win. Unfortunately, I'm sure whatever sweepstakes it was had long-ended...but that didn't stop a determined boy!

### Fruit Islands Cereal

Of course I was saving the best cereal for last. Behold! FRUIT ISLANDS CEREAL!!!!!
Why is this the best? Well maybe tied with Mr T cereal because Mr T is so dang awesome...But this cereal had the most catchiest tune of all times! AYUMAYUMA!!!! I think the reason why it stuck so much because at the very end of the commercial, the King holds up the cereal box inviting the audience, "You can say it too!"

{% include video id="OX0JW8rpQpI" provider="youtube" %}{: width="250" }

Well I don't need much of an invitation to say stuff, especially hilarious, nonsensical words that would impress any of my 80's classmates. My cousin (and best bud at the time) and I would walk around singing this like it was the best thing we ever had heard in our lives (because it was)!

If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find me....you might hear me say, AYUMAYUMA!!!!
