Today, I bring to you a pretty incredible band you gotta check out. I've been listening to them for a few years, and they rock pretty hard with some cool guitar licks. Some of their stuff sounds a little math-rock-ish, which is totally fine by me! The singer's (Dave Davison) voice is one from the likes of which you've never heard. 

They are almost like a modernized 70's rock band w/ much better guitar skills.

They have a pretty entertaining live performance on KEXP:
