Primus is a band who has been around since the late 80's. Ever since I was introduced to them by a good friend (hey J!) I've always been fascinated by them, their music and antics. 

As far back as I remember, I've [always loved](https://youtu.be/9ln9T76ieaA) heavy basslines and riffs...Not only bass, the electric instrument, but also the [lower audio](https://youtu.be/ZylIvOYV62A) [frequencies](https://youtu.be/XLajD3fOxSA). 

I think the best part about Primus is that they beat their own drum (pun intended), and you can't really say there is anyone out there like them.

One of my favorite basslines and riffs of all time is the intro you hear in this live version of "Tommy the Cat."

Another amazing song of theirs that has been stuck in my head recently is "The Toys Go Winding Down." Something about the triplets? (not sure if that's what they are called) and watching Les's fingers move across the instrument is mesmerising.

They have a bunch of other cool stuff, but would take too many pages of writing to encompass. One other interesting thing is that they composed a whole cover album of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory songs.
