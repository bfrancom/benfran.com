Whelp, unbeknownst to me and just prior to my last [post](/rightsizing-elasticsearch/), AWS [announced](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/amazon-opensearch-serverless-is-now-generally-available/) that OpenSearch Serverless is now generally available.

I look forward to using it, but my current use-case requires ElasticSearch 7.10, which the serverless option does not support.

"Serverless collections currently run OpenSearch version 2.0.x. As new versions are released, OpenSearch Serverless will automatically upgrade your collections to consume new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements."  -From: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-overview.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/serverless-overview.html)
