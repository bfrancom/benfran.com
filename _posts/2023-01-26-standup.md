In modern software development departments, many run daily standups. As an architect, my position and responsibilites can be sometimes be ambiguous, so I need to gather information from across the organization to determine our strategy. Then break this up into quarterly, weekly, and daily planning and goals.

One thing I've liked as part of our daily standups is that they have been automated using a chatbot. As a person who is in the software industry and also loves [Cal Newport's](https://www.calnewport.com/) content, I try to do these standups first thing in the morning whilst I also [time-block-planning](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/09/29/deep-habits-three-recent-daily-plans/) for the day. That way, the standup report and planning align, and I know what I'm doing when (and where).

If something unexpected pops up during the day, I try to modify my calendar to show what I am/was working on. This makes it easy to follow up on for the next day's report, or look back on to see what I worked on.
