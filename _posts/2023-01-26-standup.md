As a cloud architect, my position and responsibilities sometimes be ambiguous, so I need to gather research and information to assist in determining our strategy. Then I break this strategy up into quarterly, weekly, and daily planning/goals.

One thing I've liked as part of our daily standups is that they have been automated using a chatbot. As a person who is in the software industry and also loves [Cal Newport's](https://www.calnewport.com/) content, I try to do these standups first thing in the morning whilst also [time-block-planning](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2015/09/29/deep-habits-three-recent-daily-plans/) for the day. That way, the standup report and planning align, and I know what I'm doing when (and where).

If something unexpected pops up during the day, which it often does, I try to modify my calendar to show what I am (or was) working on. This makes it easy to follow up on for the next day's report, or look back for good historical insights.
