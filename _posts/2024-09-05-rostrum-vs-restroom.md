At church, there are labels on the walls for the different room types â€“bathrooms, offices, classrooms, cultural hall, the chapel and others.

The problem lies in the room labeled "Rostrum." Nobody has really heard this word outside this religious setting.

"Excuse me kind brother, could you tell me where the __Restroom__ is, please?"

"Oh yes, the __Rostrum__ is through that door off yonder, and up a few steps."

If there was an emergency, and the word was heard wrong, it could have devastating effects for everyone involved.
