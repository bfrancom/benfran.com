I see a common thread throughout the world where many people idolize various industry or political leaders. In most forms of media, many people are swooning over how great these leaders are (or were). A lot of folks look for outward signals to help them define or justify their success.

Just because someone is extremely wealthy and runs large companies, does that make them a success? Maybe it makes them successful in one part of life, but is that the most important part? If you can afford to be unkind or abusive, should you?

To me, true success is shown in home life, how people treat others, and how people act when nobody is watching. How do they treat their parents, spouse, kids, friends, colleagues, etc? How do they treat people that aren't in the upper echelons of society? 

I believe treating others with kindness and being like Christ is something we should all strive for daily. Am I perfect at it? No, but I continue to try.

How much better would the world be if we added more kindness and sought peace with others, especially with those in our own family? Look within to see what might be changed for the better.
